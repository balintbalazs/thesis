By targeting GFP with small, high-affinity antibodies coupled to organic dyes, we achieved nanometer spatial resolution and minimal linkage error when analyzing microtubules, living neurons and yeast cells. We show that in combination with libraries encoding GFP-tagged proteins, virtually any known protein can immediately be used in super-resolution microscopy and that simplified labeling schemes allow high-throughput super-resolution imaging.},

	abstract = {Live-cell fluorescence light microscopy has emerged as an important tool in the study of cellular biology. The development of fluorescent markers in parallel with super-resolution imaging systems has pushed light microscopy into the realm of molecular visualization at the nanometer scale. Resolutions previously only attained with electron microscopes are now within the grasp of light microscopes. However, until recently, live-cell imaging approaches have eluded super-resolution microscopy, hampering it from reaching its full potential for revealing the dynamic interactions in biology occurring at the single molecule level. Here we examine recent advances in the super-resolution imaging of living cells by reviewing recent breakthroughs in single molecule localization microscopy methods such as PALM and STORM to achieve this important goal. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The resulting two images are computationally fused yielding a superior image. The effective light sheet is thinner, and the axial resolution is increased by square root 2 over single-directional SPIM. The multidirectional illumination proves essential in biological specimens such as millimeter-sized embryos. The performance of mSPIM is demonstrated by the imaging of live zebrafish embryos.},

	abstract = {In light sheet fluorescence microscopy optical sectioning is achieved by illuminating the sample orthogonally to the detection pathway with a thin, focused sheet of light. However, light scattering within the sample often deteriorates the optical sectioning effect. Here, we demonstrate that contrast and degree of confocality can greatly be increased by combining scanned light sheet fluorescence excitation and confocal slit detection. A high frame rate was achieved by using the “rolling shutter” of a scientific CMOS camera as a slit detector. Synchronizing the “rolling shutter” with the scanned illumination beam results in confocal line detection. Acquiring image data with selective plane illumination minimizes photo-damage while simultaneously enhancing contrast, optical sectioning and signal-to-noise ratio. Thus the imaging principle presented here merges the benefits of scanned light sheet microscopy and line-scanning confocal imaging.},

This means that the point spread function of a confocal theta two-photon microscope operating at a wavelength of 780 nm has an axial full width half maximum of 230 nm. In a 4Pi(A)-confocal theta microscope the axial side lobes are removed.},

	abstract = {Live imaging has revolutionized the analysis of developmental biology over the last few years. The ability to track in real time the dynamic processes that occur at tissue and cellular levels gives a much clearer view of development, and allows greater temporal resolution, than is possible with fixed tissue. Drosophila imaginal discs are a particularly important model of many aspects of development, but their small size and location inside the larva and pupa has prevented live imaging techniques from extensively being used in their study. Here, we introduce the use of viscous culture medium to enable high resolution imaging of imaginal disc development. As a proof of principle, we have analyzed the transformation that occurs during metamorphosis of the wing imaginal disc into the mature wing and report several previously unobserved stages of this model of organogenesis. These imaging methods are especially useful to study the complex and dynamic changes that occur during morphogenesis, but we show that they can also be used to analyze other developmental and cellular events. Moreover, our viscous medium creates a platform for future adaptation of other tissue culture conditions to allow imaging of a wide range of developmental events and systems.},

	abstract = {The critical issue of all fluorescence microscopes is the efficient use of the fluorophores, i.e., to detect as many photons from the excited fluorophores as possible, as well as to excite only the fluorophores that are in focus. This issue is addressed in EMBL’s implementation of a light sheet based microscope [single plane illumination microscope (SPIM)], which illuminates only the fluorophores in the focal plane of the detection objective lens. The light sheet is a beam that is collimated in one and focused in the other direction. Since no fluorophores are excited outside the detectors’ focal plane, the method also provides intrinsic optical sectioning. The total number of observable time points can be improved by several orders of magnitude when compared to a confocal fluorescence microscope. The actual improvement factor depends on the number of planes acquired and required to achieve a certain signal to noise ratio. A SPIM consists of five basic units, which address (1) light detection, (2) illumination of the specimen, (3) generation of an appropriate beam of light, (4) translation and rotation of the specimen, and finally (5) control of different mechanical and electronic parts, data collection, and postprocessing of the data. We first describe the basic building units of EMBL’s SPIM and its most relevant properties. We then cover the basic principles underlying this instrument and its unique properties such as the efficient usage of the fluorophores, the reduced photo toxic effects, the true optical sectioning capability, and the excellent axial resolution. We also discuss how an isotropic resolution can be achieved. The optical setup, the control hardware, and the control scheme are explained in detail. We also describe some less obvious refinements of the basic setup that result in an improved performance. The properties of the instrument are demonstrated by images of biological samples that were imaged with one of EMBL’s SPIMs.},

Low photo-toxicity and high-speed multiview acquisition have made selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) a popular choice for studies of organ morphogenesis and function in zebrafish, Drosophila, and other model organisms. A multitude of different light sheet microscopes have emerged for the noninvasive imaging of specimens ranging from single molecules to cells, tissues, and entire embryos. In particular, developmental biology can benefit from the ability to watch developmental events occur in real time in an entire embryo, thereby advancing our understanding on how cells form tissues and organs. However, it presents a new challenge to our existing data and image processing tools. This review gives an overview of where we stand as light sheet microscopy branches out, explores new areas, and becomes more specialized.},

In contrast to conventional wide-field and confocal fluorescence microscopes, a light sheet illuminates only the focal plane of the detection objective lens from the side. Excitation is, thus, restricted to the fluorophores in the volume near the focal plane. This provides optical sectioning and allows the use of regular cameras in the detection process. Compared to confocal fluorescence microscopy, LSFM reduces photo bleaching and photo toxicity by up to three orders of magnitude. In LSFM, the specimen is embedded in a transparent block of hydrogel and positioned relative to the stationary light sheet using precise motorized translation and rotation stages. This feature is used to image any plane in a specimen. Additionally, multiple views obtained along different angles can be combined into a single data set with an improved resolution. LSFMs are very well suited for imaging large live specimens over long periods of time. However, they also perform well with very small specimens such as single yeast cells. This perspective introduces the principles of LSFM, explains the challenges of specimen preparation, and introduces the basics of a microscopy that takes advantage of multiple views.},

To avoid a large context memory, Golomb parameter is selected based on the coding states and the prediction residuals of up to two immediate neighbors, one in each dimension. The FLIC algorithm has low memory footprint and dissolves the data dependencies in JPEG-LS to facilitate parallelization. Experimental results show that the FLIC algorithm achieves a throughput speedup factor of 3.7 over JPEG-LS with less than 4\% compression performance penalty.

It is conceived as a “low complexity projection” of the universal context modeling paradigm, matching its modeling unit to a simple coding unit. By combining simplicity with the compression potential of context models, the algorithm “enjoys the best of both worlds.” It is based on a simple fixed context model, which approaches the capability of the more complex universal techniques for capturing high-order dependencies. The model is tuned for efficient performance in conjunction with an extended family of Golomb (1966) type codes, which are adaptively chosen, and an embedded alphabet extension for coding of low-entropy image regions. LOCO-I attains compression ratios similar or superior to those obtained with state-of-the-art schemes based on arithmetic coding. Moreover, it is within a few percentage points of the best available compression ratios, at a much lower complexity level. We discuss the principles underlying the design of LOCO-I, and its standardization into JPEC-LS},

A simple adaptive prediction scheme is presented that exploits temporal correlations or spectral correlations in addition to spatial correlations. It is seen that even with motion compensation, schemes that utilize only temporal correlations do not perform significantly better than schemes that utilize only spectral correlations. Hence, we look at hybrid schemes that make use of both spectral and temporal correlations. The hybrid schemes give significant improvement in performance over other techniques. Besides prediction schemes, we also look at some simple error modeling techniques that take into account prediction errors made in spectrally and/or temporally adjacent pixels in order to efficiently encode the prediction residual.

	abstract = {Wavelets are a relatively recent development in applied mathematics. Their name itself was coined approximately a decade ago (Morlet, Arens, Fourgeau, and Giard (1982), Morlet (1983), Grossmann and Morlet (1984)); in the last ten years interest in them has grown at an explosive rate. There are several reasons for their present success. On the one hand, the concept of wavelets can be viewed as a synthesis of ideas which originated during the last twenty or thirty years in engineering (subband coding), physics (coherent states, renormalization group), and pure mathematics (study of Calderón—Zygmund operators). As a consequence of these interdisciplinary origins, wavelets appeal to scientists and engineers of many different backgrounds. On the other hand, wavelets are a fairly simple mathematical tool with a great variety of possible applications. Already they have led to exciting applications in signal analysis (sound, images) (some early references are Kronland-Martinet, Morlet and Grossmann (1987), Mallat (1989b), (1989c); more recent references are given later) and numerical analysis (fast algorithms for integral transforms in Beylkin, Coifman, and Rokhlin (1991)); many other applications are being studied. This wide applicability also contributes to the interest they generate. This book contains ten lectures I delivered as the principal speaker at the CBMS conference on wavelets organized in June 1990 by the Mathematics Department at the University of Lowell, Massachusetts. According to the usual format of the CBMS conferences, other speakers (G. Battle, G. Beylkin, C. Chui, A. Cohen, R. Coifman, K. Gröchenig, J. Liandrat, S. Mallat, B. Torrésani, and A. Willsky) provided lectures on their work related to wavelets. Moreover, three workshops were organized, on applications to physics and inverse problems (chaired by B. DeFacio), group theory and harmonic analysis (H. Feichtinger), and signal analysis (M. Vetterli). The audience consisted of researchers active in the field of wavelets as well as of mathematicians and other scientists and engineers who knew little about wavelets and hoped to learn more. This second group constituted the largest part of the audience. I saw it as my task to provide a tutorial on wavelets to this part of the audience, which would then be a solid grounding for more recent work exposed by the other lecturers and myself.},

The compression scheme is described together with formulas that determine optimized control parameters to allow any input and compressed dynamic ranges to be accommodated, including joining to uncompressed data regions where zero data errors are desired to protect low count information. Further formulas are presented that allow optimized reconstruction values and maximum reconstruction error limits to be determined. Finally, some examples are presented that demonstrate its particular suitability for scientific applications.},

To meet these requirements, we developed isotropic multiview (IsoView) light-sheet microscopy, which rapidly images large specimens via simultaneous light-sheet illumination and fluorescence detection along four orthogonal directions. Combining these four views by means of high-throughput multiview deconvolution yields images with high resolution in all three dimensions. We demonstrate whole-animal functional imaging of Drosophila larvae at a spatial resolution of 1.1-2.5 μm and temporal resolution of 2 Hz for several hours. We also present spatially isotropic whole-brain functional imaging in Danio rerio larvae and spatially isotropic multicolor imaging of fast cellular dynamics across gastrulating Drosophila embryos. Compared with conventional light-sheet microscopy, IsoView microscopy improves spatial resolution at least sevenfold and decreases resolution anisotropy at least threefold. Compared with existing high-resolution light-sheet techniques, IsoView microscopy effectively doubles the penetration depth and provides subsecond temporal resolution for specimens 400-fold larger than could previously be imaged.},

Light-sheet microscopy techniques using two-objective, orthogonal illumination and detection require a highly constrained sample geometry and either physical sample translation or complex synchronization of illumination and detection planes. In contrast, SCAPE microscopy acquires images using an angled, swept light sheet in a single-objective, en face geometry. Unique confocal descanning and image rotation optics map this moving plane onto a stationary high-speed camera, permitting completely translationless three-dimensional imaging of intact samples at rates exceeding 20 volumes per second.

State-of-the-art multi-view (MV) deconvolution simultaneously fuses and deconvolves the images in 3D, but processing takes a multiple of the acquisition time and constitutes the bottleneck in the imaging pipeline. Here we show that MV deconvolution in 3D can finally be achieved in real-time by processing cross-sectional planes individually on the massively parallel architecture of a graphics processing unit (GPU). Our approximation is valid in the typical case where the rotation axis lies in the imaging plane.

This involves the use of a modified phase cross-correlation function, which produces a very sharp maximum. Finally the data sets are merged using figure-of-merit and local area scaling techniques borrowed from x-ray protein crystallography. We demonstrate the application of this technique to data sets from a metaphase plate in an embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. As expected, the merged reconstruction combined the highest resolution available in the individual data sets. As estimated from the Fourier transform, the final resolution is 0.25 microns in x and y and 0.4 microns in z. In the final reconstruction all ten chromosome arms can be easily delineated; this was not possible in the individual data sets. Within many of the arms the two individual chromatids can be seen. In some cases the chromatids are wrapped around each other helically, in others they lie alongside each other in a parallel arrangement.},

	abstract = {Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.
Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems.   These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space,   and  search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.},

A method is presented which uses only Fourier interpolation. The new method has a similar computational complexity to the old, and is exactly reversible. The method uses the well-known decomposition of rotation into three pure shears. Each shear is performed using a 2D extension of the 1D Fourier shift theorem. This allows the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to be used. With appropriate data padding (such as zero padding) in both the real and Fourier domains, the procedure gives near perfect results and minimal loss of information in multiple rotation tests.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Multi-view microscopy techniques such as Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) are powerful tools for 3D + time studies of live embryos in developmental biology. The sample is imaged from several points of view, acquiring a set of 3D views that are then combined or fused in order to overcome their individual limitations. Views fusion is still an open problem despite recent contributions in the field.
Results: We developed a wavelet-based multi-view fusion method that, due to wavelet decomposition properties, is able to combine the complementary directional information from all available views into a single volume. Our method is demonstrated on LSFM acquisitions from live sea urchin and zebrafish embryos. The fusion results show improved overall contrast and details when compared with any of the acquired volumes. The proposed method does not need knowledge of the system's point spread function (PSF) and performs better than other existing PSF independent fusion methods.
Availability and Implementation: The described method was implemented in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc., USA) and a graphic user interface was developed in Java.
The software, together with two sample datasets, is available at http://www.die.upm.es/im/software/SPIMFusionGUI.zip
A public release, free of charge for non-commercial use, is planned after the publication of this article.

	abstract = {Although fluorescence microscopy provides a crucial window into the physiology of living specimens, many biological processes are too fragile, are too small, or occur too rapidly to see clearly with existing tools. We crafted ultrathin light sheets from two-dimensional optical lattices that allowed us to image three-dimensional (3D) dynamics for hundreds of volumes, often at subsecond intervals, at the diffraction limit and beyond. We applied this to systems spanning four orders of magnitude in space and time, including the diffusion of single transcription factor molecules in stem cell spheroids, the dynamic instability of mitotic microtubules, the immunological synapse, neutrophil motility in a 3D matrix, and embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. The results provide a visceral reminder of the beauty and the complexity of living systems.
Introduction In vivo imaging provides a window into the spatially complex, rapidly evolving physiology of the cell that structural imaging alone cannot. However, observing this physiology directly involves inevitable tradeoffs of spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and phototoxicity. This is especially true when imaging in three dimensions, which is essential to obtain a complete picture of many dynamic subcellular processes. Although traditional in vivo imaging tools, such as widefield and confocal microscopy, and newer ones, such as light-sheet microscopy, can image in three dimensions, they sacrifice substantial spatiotemporal resolution to do so and, even then, can often be used for only very limited durations before altering the physiological state of the specimen.
Lattice light-sheet microscopy. An ultrathin structured light sheet (blue-green, center) excites fluorescence (orange) in successive planes as it sweeps through a specimen (gray) to generate a 3D image. The speed, noninvasiveness, and high spatial resolution of this approach make it a promising tool for in vivo 3D imaging of fast dynamic processes in cells and embryos, as shown here in five surrounding examples. Lattice light-sheet microscopy. An ultrathin structured light sheet (blue-green, center) excites fluorescence (orange) in successive planes as it sweeps through a specimen (gray) to generate a 3D image. The speed, noninvasiveness, and high spatial resolution of this approach make it a promising tool for in vivo 3D imaging of fast dynamic processes in cells and embryos, as shown here in five surrounding examples.
Rationale To address these limitations, we developed a new microscope using ultrathin light sheets derived from two-dimensional (2D) optical lattices. These are scanned plane-by-plane through the specimen to generate a 3D image. The thinness of the sheet leads to high axial resolution and negligible photobleaching and background outside of the focal plane, while its simultaneous illumination of the entire field of view permits imaging at hundreds of planes per second even at extremely low peak excitation intensities. By implementing either superresolution structured illumination or by dithering the lattice to create a uniform light sheet, we imaged cells and small embryos in three dimensions, often at subsecond intervals, for hundreds to thousands of time points at the diffraction limit and beyond.
Results We demonstrated the technique on 20 different biological processes spanning four orders of magnitude in space and time, including the binding kinetics of single Sox2 transcription factor molecules, 3D superresolution photoactivated localization microscopy of nuclear lamins, dynamic organelle rearrangements and 3D tracking of microtubule plus ends during mitosis, neutrophil motility in a collagen mesh, and subcellular protein localization and dynamics during embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Throughout, we established the performance advantages of lattice light-sheet microscopy compared with previous techniques and highlighted phenomena that, when seen at increased spatiotemporal detail, may hint at previously unknown biological mechanisms.
Conclusion Photobleaching and phototoxicity are typically reduced by one to two orders of magnitude relative to that seen with a 1D scanned Bessel beam or the point array scanned excitation of spinning disk confocal microscopy. This suggests that the instantaneous peak power delivered to the specimen may be an even more important metric of cell health than the total photon dose and should enable extended 3D observation of endogenous levels of even sparsely expressed proteins produced by genome editing. Improvements of similar magnitude in imaging speed and a twofold gain in axial resolution relative to confocal microscopy yield 4D spatiotemporal resolution high enough to follow fast, nanoscale dynamic processes that would otherwise be obscured by poor resolution along one or more axes of spacetime. Last, the negligible background makes lattice light-sheet microscopy a promising platform for the extension of all methods of superresolution to larger and more densely fluorescent specimens and enables the study of signaling, transport, and stochastic self-assembly in complex environments with single-molecule sensitivity.
From single molecules to embryos in living color
Animation defines life, and the three-dimensional (3D) imaging of dynamic biological processes occurring within living specimens is essential to understand life. However, in vivo imaging, especially in 3D, involves inevitable tradeoffs of resolution, speed, and phototoxicity. Chen et al. describe a microscope that can address these concerns. They used a class of nondiffracting beams, known as 2D optical lattices, which spread the excitation energy across the entire field of view while simultaneously eliminating out-of-focus excitation. Lattice light sheets increase the speed of image acquisition and reduce phototoxicity, which expands the range of biological problems that can be investigated. The authors illustrate the power of their approach using 20 distinct biological systems ranging from single-molecule binding kinetics to cell migration and division, immunology, and embryonic development.

	abstract = {Photo-activation localization microscopy is a far-field superresolution imaging technique based on the localization of single molecules with subdiffraction limit precision. Known under acronyms such as PALM (photo-activated localization microscopy) or STORM (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy), these techniques achieve superresolution by allowing only a sparse, random set of molecules to emit light at any given time and subsequently localizing each molecule with great precision. Recently, such techniques have been extended to three dimensions, opening up unprecedented possibilities to explore the structure and function of cells. Interestingly, proper engineering of the three-dimensional (3D) point spread function (PSF) through additional optics has been demonstrated to theoretically improve 3D position estimation and ultimately resolution. In this paper, an optimal 3D single-molecule localization estimator is presented in a general framework for noisy, aberrated and/or engineered PSF imaging. To find the position of each molecule, a phase-retrieval enabled maximum-likelihood estimator is implemented. This estimator is shown to be efficient, meaning it reaches the fundamental Cramer–Rao lower bound of x, y, and z localization precision. Experimental application of the phase-retrieval enabled maximum-likelihood estimator using a particular engineered PSF microscope demonstrates unmatched low-photon-count 3D wide-field single-molecule localization performance.},

The success of this promising technology has mainly been limited by the lack of suitable techniques for mounting fragile samples. Embedding zebrafish embryos in agarose, which is common in conventional confocal microscopy, has resulted in severe growth defects and unreliable results. In this study, we systematically quantified the viability and mobility of zebrafish embryos mounted under more suitable conditions. We found that tubes made of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) filled with low concentrations of agarose or methylcellulose provided an optimal balance between sufficient confinement of the living embryo in a physiological environment over 3 days and optical clarity suitable for fluorescence imaging. We also compared the effect of different concentrations of Tricaine on the development of zebrafish and provide guidelines for its optimal use depending on the application. Our results will make light sheet microscopy techniques applicable to more fields of developmental biology, in particular the multiview long-term imaging of zebrafish embryos and other small organisms. Furthermore, the refinement of sample preparation for in toto and in vivo imaging will promote other emerging optical imaging techniques, such as optical projection tomography (OPT).},

In our four-lens selective plane illumination microscope (SPIM) setup the development of multiple embryos is recorded in parallel and a map of all labelled cells is obtained for each embryo in {\textless}10 s. In these panoramic projections, cell segmentation and flow analysis reveal characteristic migration patterns and global tissue remodelling in the early endoderm. Merging data from many samples uncover stereotypic patterns that are fundamental to endoderm development in every embryo.

Early zebrafish development can be captured by standard light-sheet microscopy, but new imaging strategies are required to obtain high-quality data of late development or of less transparent organisms. We combined digital scanned laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy with incoherent structured-illumination microscopy (DSLM-SI) and created structured-illumination patterns with continuously adjustable frequencies. Our method discriminates the specimen-related scattered background from signal fluorescence, thereby removing out-of-focus light and optimizing the contrast of in-focus structures. DSLM-SI provides rapid control of the illumination pattern, exceptional imaging quality and high imaging speeds. We performed long-term imaging of zebrafish development for 58 h and fast multiple-view imaging of early Drosophila melanogaster development. We reconstructed cell positions over time from the Drosophila DSLM-SI data and created a fly digital embryo.},

To achieve this goal, one promising approach is optical imaging of fluorescent calcium indicators, but typically the tens or hundreds of cells imaged simultaneously comprise only a tiny percentage of the neurons in an intact circuit. Here, we show that a recent innovation, objective-coupled planar illumination (OCPI) microscopy, permits simultaneous recording from three-dimensional volumes containing many thousand neurons. We used OCPI microscopy to record chemosensory responses in the mouse vomeronasal epithelium, for which expression of hundreds of receptor types implies high functional diversity. The implications of this diversity for sensory coding were examined using several classes of previously reported vomeronasal ligands, including sulfated steroids. A collection of just 12 sulfated steroids activated more than a quarter of the neurons in the apical vomeronasal epithelium; unexpectedly, responses were functionally organized into a modest number of classes with characteristic spatial distribution. Recording from a whole sensory system thus revealed new organizational principles.},

	abstract = {The Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is a powerful model for studying neural development, but conventional imaging methods are either too slow or phototoxic to take full advantage of this system. To solve these problems, we developed an inverted selective plane illumination microscopy (iSPIM) module for noninvasive high-speed volumetric imaging of living samples. iSPIM is designed as a straightforward add-on to an inverted microscope, permitting conventional mounting of specimens and facilitating SPIM use by development and neurobiology laboratories. iSPIM offers a volumetric imaging rate 30× faster than currently used technologies, such as spinning-disk confocal microscopy, at comparable signal-to-noise ratio. This increased imaging speed allows us to continuously monitor the development of C, elegans embryos, scanning volumes every 2 s for the 14-h period of embryogenesis with no detectable phototoxicity. Collecting ∼25,000 volumes over the entirety of embryogenesis enabled in toto visualization of positions and identities of cell nuclei. By merging two-color iSPIM with automated lineaging techniques we realized two goals: (i) identification of neurons expressing the transcription factor CEH-10/Chx10 and (ii) visualization of their neurodevelopmental dynamics. We found that canal-associated neurons use somal translocation and amoeboid movement as they migrate to their final position in the embryo. We also visualized axon guidance and growth cone dynamics as neurons circumnavigate the nerve ring and reach their targets in the embryo. The high-speed volumetric imaging rate of iSPIM effectively eliminates motion blur from embryo movement inside the egg case, allowing characterization of dynamic neurodevelopmental events that were previously inaccessible.},

	abstract = {The capture of transient scenes at high imaging speed has been long sought by photographers, with early examples being the well known recording in 1878 of a horse in motion and the 1887 photograph of a supersonic bullet. However, not until the late twentieth century were breakthroughs achieved in demonstrating ultrahigh-speed imaging (more than 105 frames per second). In particular, the introduction of electronic imaging sensors based on the charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology revolutionized high-speed photography, enabling acquisition rates of up to 107 frames per second. Despite these sensors/' widespread impact, further increasing frame rates using CCD or CMOS technology is fundamentally limited by their on-chip storage and electronic readout speed. Here we demonstrate a two-dimensional dynamic imaging technique, compressed ultrafast photography (CUP), which can capture non-repetitive time-evolving events at up to 1011 frames per second. Compared with existing ultrafast imaging techniques, CUP has the prominent advantage of measuring an x-y-t (x, y, spatial coordinates; t, time) scene with a single camera snapshot, thereby allowing observation of transient events with temporal resolution as tens of picoseconds. Furthermore, akin to traditional photography, CUP is receive-only, and so does not need the specialized active illumination required by other single-shot ultrafast imagers. As a result, CUP can image a variety of luminescent—such as fluorescent or bioluminescent—objects. Using CUP, we visualize four fundamental physical phenomena with single laser shots only: laser pulse reflection and refraction, photon racing in two media, and faster-than-light propagation of non-information (that is, motion that appears faster than the speed of light but cannot convey information). Given CUP/'s capability, we expect it to find widespread applications in both fundamental and applied sciences, including biomedical research.},

Unlike popular wide-field and confocal methods, plane-illumination microscopy limits excitation to the information-rich vicinity of the focal plane, providing effective optical sectioning and high speed while minimizing out-of-focus background and premature photobleaching. Here we used scanned Bessel beams in conjunction with structured illumination and/or two-photon excitation to create thinner light sheets ({\textless}0.5 μm) better suited to three-dimensional (3D) subcellular imaging. As demonstrated by imaging the dynamics of mitochondria, filopodia, membrane ruffles, intracellular vesicles and mitotic chromosomes in live cells, the microscope currently offers 3D isotropic resolution down to {\textasciitilde}0.3 μm, speeds up to nearly 200 image planes per second and the ability to noninvasively acquire hundreds of 3D data volumes from single living cells encompassing tens of thousands of image frames.},

	abstract = {Although confocal microscopes have considerably smaller contribution of out-of-focus light than widefield microscopes, the confocal images can still be enhanced mathematically if the optical and data acquisition effects are accounted for. For that, several deconvolution algorithms have been proposed. As a practical solution, maximum-likelihood algorithms with regularization have been used. However, the choice of regularization parameters is often unknown although it has considerable effect on the result of deconvolution process. The aims of this work were: to find good estimates of deconvolution parameters; and to develop an open source software package that would allow testing different deconvolution algorithms and that would be easy to use in practice. Here, Richardson–Lucy algorithm has been implemented together with the total variation regularization in an open source software package IOCBio Microscope. The influence of total variation regularization on deconvolution process is determined by one parameter. We derived a formula to estimate this regularization parameter automatically from the images as the algorithm progresses. To assess the effectiveness of this algorithm, synthetic images were composed on the basis of confocal images of rat cardiomyocytes. From the analysis of deconvolved results, we have determined under which conditions our estimation of total variation regularization parameter gives good results. The estimated total variation regularization parameter can be monitored during deconvolution process and used as a stopping criterion. An inverse relation between the optimal regularization parameter and the peak signal-to-noise ratio of an image is shown. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the developed software by deconvolving images of rat cardiomyocytes with stained mitochondria and sarcolemma obtained by confocal and widefield microscopes.},

Three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge. We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures.},

By applying maximum likelihood estimation to this problem, this paper derives theoretical limits on the ability to locate signal position. The limiting error in position measurement is shown to be a simple function of the instrument resolution, the density of sample points, and the signal‐to‐noise ratio of the data. An interesting conclusion is that position information on a much finer scale than the minimum instrument sampling interval is contained in data of modest signal‐to‐noise ratio. The common procedure of excluding the portion of the data lying below an amplitude threshold to guard against background fluctuations is incorporated in the maximum likelihood analysis. It is shown that selection of the optimum amplitude threshold level depends on the type of noise present in the data, and can be an important factor in position accuracy. The analytical results exhibit close agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of position accuracy in the presence of noise.},

The factors that limit the precision of these techniques are examined and a simple equation derived that describes the precision of localization over a wide range of conditions. In addition, a localization algorithm motivated from least-squares fitting theory is constructed and tested both on image stacks of 30-nm fluorescent beads and on computer-generated images (Monte Carlo simulations). Results from the algorithm show good agreement with the derived precision equation for both the simulations and actual images. The availability of a simple equation to describe localization precision helps investigators both in assessing the quality of an experimental apparatus and in directing attention to the factors that limit further improvement. The precision of localization scales as the inverse square root of the number of photons in the spot for the shot noise limited case and as the inverse of the number of photons for the background noise limited case. The optimal image magnification depends on the expected number of photons and background noise, but, for most cases of interest, the pixel size should be about equal to the standard deviation of the point spread function.},

An empirically derived analytic approximation to the diffraction OTF which is much easier to calculate, is formulated.

Selective plane illumination microscopy has provided significant gains in the spatial and temporal acquisition of fluorescence specimens several mm in thickness. With commercial systems now available, this method promises to expand on recent advances in 2-photon deep-tissue imaging with improved speed and reduced photobleaching compared to laser scanning confocal microscopy. Superresolution microscopes are also available in several modalities and can be coupled with selective plane illumination techniques. The combination of methods to increase resolution, acquisition speed, and depth of collection are now being married to common microscope systems, enabling scientists to make significant advances in live cell and in situ imaging in real time.

The total variation of the image is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the noise. The constraints are imposed using Lanrange multipliers. The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t → ∞ the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set.},

	abstract = {Confocal laser scanning microscopy is a powerful and increasingly popular technique for 3D imaging of biological specimens. However the acquired images are degraded by blur from out-of-focus light and Poisson noise due to photon-limited detection. Several deconvolution methods have been proposed to reduce these degradations, including the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, which computes a maximum likelihood estimation adapted to Poisson statistics. However this method tends to amplify noise if used without regularizing constraint. Here, we propose to combine the Richardson-Lucy algorithm with a regularizing constraint based on total variation, whose smoothing avoids oscillations while preserving edges. We show on simulated images that this constraint improves the deconvolution result both visually and using quantitative measures.},

	title = {Multiview reconstruction for 3D {Images} from light sheet based fluorescence microscopy},
	url = {http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/8753/},
	abstract = {Fluorescence microscopy allows for the recording of large data sets in high resolution. The analysis of cells and organs in the three dimensional space over time and the exact description of their development is of utmost importance, e.g. in order to discriminate pathological from normal trends during the development of organisms. Oftentimes the human eye does not suffice to observe these trends in the recorded data, since the images are degraded by noise and blur and first need to be reconstructed in their three dimensional shape. The main problems with the recording of larger organisms are the absorption of light in axial direction, as well as noise, diffraction and blurring of light due to the system and object dependent point spread function. The recorded data is incomplete and can only be reconstructed by using prior knowledge. The reconstruction of the original data from the recordings alone is therefore an ill-posed problem. A new microscopy technology, the light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), has been developed in the past ten years in order to make the recording of small living animals at cellular resolution over time feasible. The object is recorded from multiple views by rotating and translating the robustly embedded sample. Although a similar setting is known for multiview reconstruction of computer tomography or stereo recordings, well-established techniques from these fields cannot be directly applied to the LSFM reconstruction. However, it is advisable to divide the reconstruction problem into two smaller subproblems, which has also been done in the two applications mentioned above. The two subproblems are registration and fusion of the registered data sets. In this work a new gray-value based and a new point set based registration algorithm were developed for the registration of microscopic data. The particular challenge for the algorithms are the noise, blur and missing parts of the data. For these challenges a robust quality metric is necessary in order to measure the goodness of the registration result. The "Structural Similarity Index Measure" showed particularly good results for the task of registering LSFM images. Nevertheless a precise and validated registration is only possible with the help of additionally included point markers. Position invariant descriptors for single points can be computed by group integration on the point markers. These descriptors are further used to determine point correspondences between several recordings of the same object and to register them. For the final data fusion we developed a spatially variant method, which uses the spherical markers to estimate the local point spread function. The most plausible reconstruction of the original object is computed using the estimation for the point spread function, an appropriate noise model and an assumption about the smoothness of the original data. The image restoration problem is formulated in a Bayesian framework and solved using variational methods. We showed in experiments that in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods, our method significantly reduces the noise and sharpens the final reconstructed image. Apart from the specialized solution for the LSFM data, we also show successful applications of our methods on blind deconvolution of standard microscopy recordings, as well as algorithms for the comparison of structural similarity of proteins. Die Fluoreszenzmikroskopie ermöglicht die Aufnahme von großen Datensätzen in sehr hoher Auflösung. Dabei ist die Analyse der Zellen und Organe im dreidimensionalen Raum über die Zeit und die genaue Beschreibung dieser Entwicklung von besonderem Interesse, um z.B. während der Entwicklung kranke von gesunden Verläufen unterscheiden zu können. Für die Analyse der Daten reicht das menschliche Auge oft nicht aus, da die Daten durch die Aufnahme mit Rauschen und Unschärfe behaftet sind und erst in ihrer dreidimensionalen Struktur rekonstruiert werden müssen. Die zentralen Probleme bei der mikroskopischen Aufnahme größerer Objekte sind die Absorption des Lichts in axialer Richtung, sowie das Rauschen, die Streuung und das Verschmieren des Lichts durch die system- und objektabhängige Punktbildfunktion. Die aufgenommen Daten sind daher unvollständig und können nur mithilfe von Vorwissen rekonstruiert werden. Die Rekonstruktion der Originaldaten aus den Aufnahmen allein ist somit ein schlecht gestelltes Problem. In den letzten zehn Jahren wurde die Lichtschichtfluoreszenz-Mikroskopie (LSFM) entwickelt, welche die Aufzeichnung von kleinen lebenden Tieren in zellulärer Auflösung über einen längeren Zeitraum ermöglicht. Durch eine stabile Einbettung kann die Probe im LSFM leicht gedreht und verschoben werden. Dabei werden Aufnahmen aus mehreren Richtungen gewonnen, welche zusätzliche Informationen enthalten und somit das schlecht gestellte Problem etwas vereinfachen. Obwohl in der Computertomographie und der Stereorekonstruktion das Problem der Rekonstruktion eines Objektes aus mehreren Ansichten schon länger bekannt ist, können die bestehenden Lösungen aus diesen Gebieten nicht direkt für die mikroskopische Rekonstruktion angewandt werden. Jedoch empfiehlt es sich, das Problem der Rekonstruktion, wie in den vorher erwähnten Gebieten, in zwei Teilprobleme zu unterteilen. Diese sind die Registrierung und die Zusammenführung der registrierten Daten. In dieser Arbeit wurde ein neues grauwertbasiertes, sowie ein auf Punktkorrespondenzen basiertes Verfahren für die Registrierung von LSFM Daten entwickelt. Probleme bei der Registrierung mit Standardverfahren entstehen, da die Daten verrauscht, verschmiert und nicht vollständig sind. Dafür ist ein stabiles Qualitätsmaß notwendig, um die Güte der Registrierung zu messen. Das "Structural Similarity Index Measure" hat sich bei den grauwertbasierten Verfahren als besonders stabil bei der Registrierung von LSFM Daten erwiesen. Allerdings ist eine genaue und valide Registrierung nur mithilfe von zusätzlich eingefügten Markern zu erreichen. Diese Marker ermöglichen es, durch Gruppenintegration lageinvariante Deskriptoren zu gewinnen. Mit Hilfe der Deskriptoren können Punktkorrespondenzen zwischen mehreren Aufnahmen des selben Objekts bestimmt und die Aufnahmen schließlich registriert werden. Für die Zusammenführung der Daten wurde ein ortsvariantes Verfahren entwickelt, welches anhand der kugelförmigen Marker die lokale Punktbildfunktion bestimmt. Mit einem geeignetem Rauschmodel, einer Schätzung der Punktbildfunktion und Vorwissen über die Glattheit der Originaldaten wird die plausibelste Rekonstruktion des Originalobjektes aus den Aufnahmen berechnet. Das Problem der Bildrestauration wurde im Rahmen der Bayesschen Statistik formuliert und mithilfe von Variationsrechnung gelöst. Durch Vergleiche mit bereits vorhandenen Methoden wurde gezeigt, dass unsere Methode das Rauschen deutlich reduziert und das Bild schärft. Aus den spezialisierten Lösungen für LFSM Daten ergeben sich auch erfolgreiche Anwendungen zur Schärfung von konventionellen Fluoreszenzaufnahmen sowie Algorithmen zum Strukturvergleich von Proteinen.},

We present the Real-time Accurate Cell-shape Extractor (RACE), a high-throughput image analysis framework for automated three-dimensional cell segmentation in large-scale images. RACE is 55–330 times faster and 2–5 times more accurate than state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the generality of RACE by extracting cell-shape information from entire Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse embryos imaged with confocal and light-sheet microscopes. Using RACE, we automatically reconstructed cellular-resolution tissue anisotropy maps across developing Drosophila embryos and quantified differences in cell-shape dynamics in wild-type and mutant embryos. We furthermore integrated RACE with our framework for automated cell lineaging and performed joint segmentation and cell tracking in entire Drosophila embryos. RACE processed these terabyte-sized datasets on a single computer within 1.4 days. RACE is easy to use, as it requires adjustment of only three parameters, takes full advantage of state-of-the-art multi-core processors and graphics cards, and is available as open-source software for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.},

We demonstrate long-term adaptive imaging of entire developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Drosophila melanogaster embryos and perform adaptive whole-brain functional imaging in larval zebrafish. Our method improves spatial resolution and signal strength two to five-fold, recovers cellular and sub-cellular structures in many regions that are not resolved by non-adaptive imaging, adapts to spatiotemporal dynamics of genetically encoded fluorescent markers and robustly optimizes imaging performance during large-scale morphogenetic changes in living organisms.},

	abstract = {The removal of Poisson noise is often performed through the following three-step procedure. First, the noise variance is stabilized by applying the Anscombe root transformation to the data, producing a signal in which the noise can be treated as additive Gaussian with unitary variance. Second, the noise is removed using a conventional denoising algorithm for additive white Gaussian noise. Third, an inverse transformation is applied to the denoised signal, obtaining the estimate of the signal of interest. The choice of the proper inverse transformation is crucial in order to minimize the bias error which arises when the nonlinear forward transformation is applied. We introduce optimal inverses for the Anscombe transformation, in particular the exact unbiased inverse, a maximum likelihood (ML) inverse, and a more sophisticated minimum mean square error (MMSE) inverse. We then present an experimental analysis using a few state-of-the-art denoising algorithms and show that the estimation can be consistently improved by applying the exact unbiased inverse, particularly at the low-count regime. This results in a very efficient filtering solution that is competitive with some of the best existing methods for Poisson image denoising.},

	abstract = {Many digital imaging devices operate by successive photon-to-electron, electron-to-voltage, and voltage-to-digit conversions. These processes are subject to various signal-dependent errors, which are typically modeled as Poisson-Gaussian noise. The removal of such noise can be effected indirectly by applying a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) to the noisy data, denoising the stabilized data with a Gaussian denoising algorithm, and finally applying an inverse VST to the denoised data. The generalized Anscombe transformation (GAT) is often used for variance stabilization, but its unbiased inverse transformation has not been rigorously studied in the past. We introduce the exact unbiased inverse of the GAT and show that it plays an integral part in ensuring accurate denoising results. We demonstrate that this exact inverse leads to state-of-the-art results without any notable increase in the computational complexity compared to the other inverses. We also show that this inverse is optimal in the sense that it can be interpreted as a maximum likelihood inverse. Moreover, we thoroughly analyze the behavior of the proposed inverse, which also enables us to derive a closed-form approximation for it. This paper generalizes our work on the exact unbiased inverse of the Anscombe transformation, which we have presented earlier for the removal of pure Poisson noise.},

	abstract = {Image compression has been a frequent topic of presentations at ADASS. Compression is often viewed as just a technique to fit more data into a smaller space. Rather, the packing of data - its "density" - affects every facet of local data handling, long distance data transport, and the end-to-end throughput of workflows. In short, compression is one aspect of proper data structuring. For example, with FITS tile compression the efficient representation of data is combined with an expressive logistical paradigm for its manipulation. A deeper question remains. Not just how best to represent the data, but which data to represent. CCDs are linear devices. What does this mean? One thing it does not mean is that the analog-to-digital conversion of pixels must be stored using linear data numbers (DN). An alternative strategy of using non- linear representations is presented, with one motivation being to magnify the efficiency of numerical compression algorithms such as Rice.},

We show that lossy square-root compression to 1 bit of noise per pixel, followed by standard lossless compression algorithms, reduces the images to 2.5-4 bits per pixel, depending primarily upon the level of cosmic-ray contamination of the images. Compression to this level adds noise equivalent to {\textless}10\% penalty in observing time. We derive an analytic correction to flux biases inherent to the square-root compression scheme. Numerical tests on simple galaxy models confirm that galaxy fluxes and shapes are measured with systematic biases {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} induced by the compression scheme, well below the requirements of supernova and weak gravitational lensing dark-energy experiments. An accompanying paper (Vanderveld 2009) bounds the shape biases using realistic simulated images of the high-Galactic-latitude sky. The square-root preprocessing step has advantages over simple (linear) decimation when there are many bright objects or cosmic rays in the field, or when the background level will vary.},

The model also includes voltage-to-voltage, voltage-to-electrons, and analogue-to-digital converter non-linearities. The formulated model can be used to create synthetic images for testing and validation of image processing algorithms in the presence of realistic images noise. An example of the simulated CMOS photosensor and a comparison with a custom-made CMOS hardware sensor is presented. Procedures for characterisation from both light and dark noises are described. Experimental results that confirm the validity of the numerical model are provided.

Here, we introduce a self-bending point spread function (SB-PSF) based on Airy beams for three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence imaging. We designed a side-lobe-free SB-PSF and implemented a two-channel detection scheme to enable unambiguous three-dimensional localization of fluorescent molecules. The lack of diffraction and the propagation-dependent lateral bending make the SB-PSF well suited for precise three-dimensional localization of molecules over a large imaging depth. Using this method, we obtained super-resolution imaging with isotropic three-dimensional localization precision of 10–15 nm over a 3 µm imaging depth from {\textasciitilde}2,000 photons per localization.},

	abstract = {Biological structures span many orders of magnitude in size, but far-field visible light microscopy suffers from limited resolution. A new method for fluorescence imaging has been developed that can obtain spatial distributions of large numbers of fluorescent molecules on length scales shorter than the classical diffraction limit. Fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM) analyzes thousands of single fluorophores per acquisition, localizing small numbers of them at a time, at low excitation intensity. To control the number of visible fluorophores in the field of view and ensure that optically active molecules are separated by much more than the width of the point spread function, photoactivatable fluorescent molecules are used, in this case the photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP). For these photoactivatable molecules, the activation rate is controlled by the activation illumination intensity; nonfluorescent inactive molecules are activated by a high-frequency (405-nm) laser and are then fluorescent when excited at a lower frequency. The fluorescence is imaged by a CCD camera, and then the molecules are either reversibly inactivated or irreversibly photobleached to remove them from the field of view. The rate of photobleaching is controlled by the intensity of the laser used to excite the fluorescence, in this case an Ar+ ion laser. Because only a small number of molecules are visible at a given time, their positions can be determined precisely; with only ∼100 detected photons per molecule, the localization precision can be as much as 10-fold better than the resolution, depending on background levels. Heterogeneities on length scales of the order of tens of nanometers are observed by FPALM of PA-GFP on glass. FPALM images are compared with images of the same molecules by widefield fluorescence. FPALM images of PA-GFP on a terraced sapphire crystal surface were compared with atomic force microscopy and show that the full width at half-maximum of features ∼86 ± 4 nm is significantly better than the expected diffraction-limited optical resolution. The number of fluorescent molecules and their brightness distribution have also been determined using FPALM. This new method suggests a means to address a significant number of biological questions that had previously been limited by microscope resolution.},

Single fluorescent molecules in a thick polymer sample are localized in single 500-ms acquisitions with 10- to 20-nm precision over a large depth of field (2 μm) by finding the center of the 2 DH-PSF lobes. By using a photoactivatable fluorophore, repeated imaging of sparse subsets with a DH-PSF microscope provides superresolution imaging of high concentrations of molecules in all 3 dimensions. The combination of optical PSF design and digital postprocessing with photoactivatable fluorophores opens up avenues for improving 3D imaging resolution beyond the Rayleigh diffraction limit.},

We used this method—termed photoactivated localization microscopy—to image specific target proteins in thin sections of lysosomes and mitochondria; in fixed whole cells, we imaged vinculin at focal adhesions, actin within a lamellipodium, and the distribution of the retroviral protein Gag at the plasma membrane.
Proteins of interest can be labeled with fluorescent tags and located by photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) in thin sections and fixed cells at near-molecular resolution.

In standard fluorescence microscopy, however, diffraction dictates a PSF with a cigar-shaped main maximum, called the focal spot, which extends over at least half the wavelength of light ( = 400–700 nm) in the focal plane and {\textgreater} along the optical axis (z). Although concepts have been developed to sharpen the focal spot both laterally and axially, none of them has reached their ultimate goal: a spherical spot that can be arbitrarily downscaled in size. Here we introduce a fluorescence microscope that creates nearly spherical focal spots of 40–45 nm (/16) in diameter. Fully relying on focused light, this lens-based fluorescence nanoscope unravels the interior of cells noninvasively, uniquely dissecting their sub-–sized organelles.},

This process creates a tissue-hydrogel hybrid that is physically stable, that preserves fine structure, proteins and nucleic acids, and that is permeable to both visible-spectrum photons and exogenous macromolecules. Here we highlight relevant challenges and opportunities of this approach, especially with regard to integration with complementary methodologies for brain-mapping studies.},

	abstract = {During gastrulation in the mouse embryo, dynamic cell movements including epiblast invagination and mesodermal layer expansion lead to the establishment of the three-layered body plan. The precise details of these movements, however, are sometimes elusive, because of the limitations in live imaging. To overcome this problem, we developed techniques to enable observation of living mouse embryos with digital scanned light sheet microscope (DSLM). The achieved deep and high time-resolution images of GFP-expressing nuclei and following 3D tracking analysis revealed the following findings: (i) Interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) occurs in the epiblast at embryonic day (E)6 and 6.5. (ii) INM-like migration occurs in the E5.5 embryo, when the epiblast is a monolayer and not yet pseudostratified. (iii) Primary driving force for INM at E6.5 is not pressure from neighboring nuclei. (iv) Mesodermal cells migrate not as a sheet but as individual cells without coordination.},

Optimization is based on the regularized Lucy-Richardson algorithm, which we extend to deal with our more general model. The model parameters are chosen in a profound way by optimizing them on a realistic training set.

We developed digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy and recorded nuclei localization and movement in entire wild-type and mutant zebrafish embryos over the first 24 hours of development. Multiview in vivo imaging at 1.5 billion voxels per minute provides “digital embryos,” that is, comprehensive databases of cell positions, divisions, and migratory tracks. Our analysis of global cell division patterns reveals a maternally defined initial morphodynamic symmetry break, which identifies the embryonic body axis. We further derive a model of germ layer formation and show that the mesendoderm forms from one-third of the embryo's cells in a single event. Our digital embryos, with 55 million nucleus entries, are provided as a resource.
Digitized tracking of each cell during the first 24 hours of zebrafish development reveals how the body axis and germ layer are formed and provides a community resource.

While in confocal microscopy specimen size is limited to several hundred micrometers at best, using ultramicroscopy even centimeter sized objects like whole mouse embryos can be reconstructed with micrometer resolution. This is possible by using a combination of a clearing procedure and the principle of lightsheet illumination. We present ultramicroscopic 3D reconstructions of whole immunohistochemically labelled mouse embryos and adult Drosophila, giving detailed insight into their anatomy. Its speed and simplicity makes ultramicroscopy ideally suited for high-throughput phenotype screening of transgenic mice and thus will benefit the investigation of disease models.

	abstract = {Segmentation is the process of partitioning digital images into meaningful regions. The analysis of biological high content images often requires segmentation as a first step. We propose ilastik as an easy-to-use tool which allows the user without expertise in image processing to perform segmentation and classification in a unified way. ilastik learns from labels provided by the user through a convenient mouse interface. Based on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation. A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier. An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of representative images, it can be exported and used to automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using the CellProfiler pipeline). ilastik is an open source project and released under the BSD license at www.ilastik.org.},

	abstract = {Optimal four-dimensional imaging requires high spatial resolution in all dimensions, high speed and minimal photobleaching and damage. We developed a dual-view, plane illumination microscope with improved spatiotemporal resolution by switching illumination and detection between two perpendicular objectives in an alternating duty cycle. Computationally fusing the resulting volumetric views provides an isotropic resolution of 330 nm. As the sample is stationary and only two views are required, we achieve an imaging speed of 200 images/s (i.e., 0.5 s for a 50-plane volume). Unlike spinning-disk confocal or Bessel beam methods, which illuminate the sample outside the focal plane, we maintain high spatiotemporal resolution over hundreds of volumes with negligible photobleaching. To illustrate the ability of our method to study biological systems that require high-speed volumetric visualization and/or low photobleaching, we describe microtubule tracking in live cells, nuclear imaging over 14 h during nematode embryogenesis and imaging of neural wiring during Caenorhabditis elegans brain development over 5 h.},

	abstract = {Image restoration is the important process for getting back the original image, without any loss of the information. The capturing processes of imaging devices are subjected to different signal dependent noise and they are considered as Poisson-Gaussian noise. The removal of such signal dependent noise is performed by applying nonlinear variance stabilization transformations (VST) such as modified Anscombe transform. This transform stabilizes the noisy data and makes the data to have Gaussian noise distribution with a constant variance. Here, a multiscale variance stabilization transform (MS-VST) based on modified Anscombe transform has been proposed which is extremely suitable for low intensity region and can be applied to any dimensional data. The Gaussian noise can be removed by using multiresolution median transform which consists of series of smoothing of the input image. The various operations performed in this transform are median filtering, decimation and interpolation filtering. The desired noise free image can be obtained by applying an exact unbiased inverse of Anscombe transformation. It completely removes the bias error which arises when the nonlinear forward variance stabilization transform is applied. The proposed MS-VST combined with exact unbiased inverse of Anscombe transform plays an integral part in providing accurate denoising result particularly when the input SNR is very low.},

We further explicitly take into account the clipping of the data (over- and under-exposure), faithfully reproducing the nonlinear response of the sensor.

	abstract = {In certain image acquisitions processes, like in fluorescence microscopy or astronomy, only a limited number of photons can be collected due to various physical constraints. The resulting images suffer from signal dependent noise, which can be modeled as a Poisson distribution, and a low signal-to-noise ratio. However, the majority of research on noise reduction algorithms focuses on signal independent Gaussian noise. In this paper, we model noise as a combination of Poisson and Gaussian probability distributions to construct a more accurate model and adopt the contourlet transform which provides a sparse representation of the directional components in images. We also apply hidden Markov models with a framework that neatly describes the spatial and interscale dependencies which are the properties of transformation coefficients of natural images. In this paper, an effective denoising algorithm for Poisson-Gaussian noise is proposed using the contourlet transform, hidden Markov models and noise estimation in the transform domain. We supplement the algorithm by cycle spinning and Wiener filtering for further improvements. We finally show experimental results with simulations and fluorescence microscopy images which demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed approach.},

Among them, single molecule based super-resolution optical microscopy techniques require high localization accuracy as well as computation of large data sets in the order of 10(5) single molecule detections to reconstruct a single image. We hereby present an algorithm based on image wavelet segmentation and single particle centroid determination, and compare its performance with the commonly used gaussian fitting of the point spread function. We performed realistic simulations at different signal-to-noise ratios and particle densities and show that the calculation time using the wavelet approach can be more than one order of magnitude faster than that of gaussian fitting without a significant degradation of the localization accuracy, from 1 nm to 4 nm in our range of study. We propose a simulation-based estimate of the resolution of an experimental single molecule acquisition.},

Also in 1948, Bennett published the first high-resolution analysis of quantization and an exact analysis of quantization noise for Gaussian processes, and Shannon published the beginnings of rate distortion theory, which would provide a theory for quantization as analog-to-digital conversion and as data compression. Beginning with these three papers of fifty years ago, we trace the history of quantization from its origins through this decade, and we survey the fundamentals of the theory and many of the popular and promising techniques for quantization},

The first is the quantizer where the input data is mapped into a finite set of rational numbers and the second is the channel which includes the encoder, transmitter, transmission medium, receiver, and decoder. For any given probability density on the input data and any given channel matrix, we determine the quantization values and transition levels which minimize the total mean-square error. We also determine the best quantizer structure under the constraint that quantization values and transition levels be equally spaced. For the special case of a noiseless channel both results reduce to those of Max [2]. As an example we consider the case of Gaussian input data and phase-shift keyed (PSK) transmission in additive white Gaussian noise. The transmitter is both peak and average power limited, and the system operates in real time. Both the natural and Gray codes are considered. The mean-square error, quantizer entropy, channel capacity, and information rate are computed for the system using the optimum uniform quantizer. Finally, we show that it is important to take the channel into consideration when designing the quantizer even when the system is not constrained to operate in real time.},

More and more, the question asked by clinicians is how much and where, rather than a simple statement on the presence or absence of abnormalities.

The core of the semiautomatic image analysis system is a supervised artificial neural network classifier augmented with dedicated preand postprocessing algorithms, including anisotropic noise filtering and a surface-fitting method for the correction of spatial intensity variations. The study was focused on the quantitation of white matter lesions in the human brain. A total of 36 images from six brain volumes was analyzed twice by each of two operators, under supervision of a neuroradiologist. Both the intra- and interrater variability of the methods were studied in terms of the average tissue area detected per slice, the correlation coefficients between area measurements, and a measure of similarity derived from the kappa statistic. The results indicate that, compared to a manual method, the use of the semiautomatic technique not only facilitates the analysis of the images, but also has similar or lower intra- and interrater variabilities},

One reason for this is that the field has largely conformed to a do-it-yourself ethic, although the challenges of big image data cannot be overstated. With the most powerful implementations of LSFM available to only a few groups worldwide, the scope of this technique is unnecessarily limited. Here we elucidate the key developments and define a simple set of underlying principles governing LSFM.

	abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) relies on the switching of fluorescent molecules between a fluorescent and a dark state to achieve super resolution. This process is inherently dependent on the intensity distribution of the laser light used for both activation from the dark state and excitation of the bright state. Typically, laser light is coupled directly or via a single-mode fiber into the microscope, which leads to a Gaussian intensity profile in total internal reflection (TIR) or epi illumination. As a result, switching dynamics and brightness of the fluorescent molecules vary strongly across the field of view, impacting their localization precision and impeding quantitative analysis. Here we present a simple illumination scheme based on the use of a multimode fiber and a laser speckle-reducer, which results in a flat, homogeneous and speckle-free illumination across the entire field of view. In addition, we combined homogeneous multimode excitation of the sample with single-mode based TIR activation to simultaneously obtain the advantages of both approaches: uniform brightness of single fluorophores and TIR-like optical sectioning.},

Technological advances in automated microscopy now allow rapid acquisition of many images without human intervention, images that can be used for large-scale screens. The main challenge in such screens is the conversion of the raw images into interpretable information and hence discoveries. This post-acquisition component of image-based screens requires computational steps to identify cells, choose the cells of interest, assess their phenotype, and identify statistically significant `hits'. Designing such an analysis pipeline requires careful consideration of the necessary hardware and software components, image analysis, statistical analysis and data presentation tools. Given the increasing availability of such hardware and software, these types of experiments have come within the reach of individual labs, heralding many interesting new ways of acquiring biological knowledge.},

We compare our method to other lossless compression methods and to lossy JPEG, JPEG2000 and H.264 compression for various kinds of video microscopy data including fluorescence video and brightfield video. We find that for certain data sets, the new method compresses much better than lossless compression with no impact on analysis results. It achieved a best compressed size of 0.77\% of the original size, 25× smaller than the best lossless technique (which yields 20\% for the same video). The compressed size scales with the video's scientific data content. Further testing showed that existing lossy algorithms greatly impacted data analysis at similar compression sizes.},

Efficient image-compression techniques are indispensable to manage these vast amounts of data. This goal is frequently achieved using lossy compression algorithms such as JPEG and JPEG2000. However, these algorithms are optimized to preserve visual quality but not necessarily the integrity of the scientific data, which are often analyzed in an automated manner. Here, we propose three observer-independent compression algorithms, designed to preserve information contained in the images. These algorithms were constructed using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computed from a single image as a quality measure to establish which image components may be discarded. The compression efficiency was measured as a function of image brightness and SNR. The alterations introduced by compression in biological images were estimated using brightness histograms (earth's mover distance (EMD) algorithm) and textures (Haralick parameters). Furthermore, a microscope test pattern was used to assess the effect of compression on the effective resolution of microscope images.},

	abstract = {Digital imaging has provided scientists with new opportunities to acquire and manipulate data using techniques that were difficult or impossible to employ in the past. Because digital images are easier to manipulate than film images, new problems have emerged. One growing concern in the scientific community is that digital images are not being handled with sufficient care. The problem is twofold: (1) the very small, yet troubling, number of intentional falsifications that have been identified, and (2) the more common unintentional, inappropriate manipulation of images for publication. Journals and professional societies have begun to address the issue with specific digital imaging guidelines. Unfortunately, the guidelines provided often do not come with instructions to explain their importance. Thus they deal with what should or should not be done, but not the associated ‘why’ that is required for understanding the rules. This article proposes 12 guidelines for scientific digital image manipulation and discusses the technical reasons behind these guidelines. These guidelines can be incorporated into lab meetings and graduate student training in order to provoke discussion and begin to bring an end to the culture of “data beautification”.},

Scientists must remember that digital images are numerically sampled data that represent the state of a specific sample when examined with a specific instrument. These data should be carefully managed. Changes made to the original data need to be tracked like the protocols used for other experimental procedures.

We then classified the genes on the basis of the effect of their depletion on organization of the Golgi membranes. Here we show that depletion of class A genes redistributes Golgi membranes into the endoplasmic reticulum, depletion of class B genes leads to Golgi fragmentation, depletion of class C genes leads to aggregation of Golgi membranes, and depletion of class D genes causes no obvious change.

Ribosome biogenesis is a highly complex process requiring many assisting factors. Studies in yeast have yielded comprehensive knowledge of the cellular machinery involved in this process. However, many aspects of ribosome synthesis are different in higher eukaryotes, and the global set of mammalian ribosome biogenesis factors remains unexplored. We used an imaging-based, genome-wide RNAi screen to find human proteins involved in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Our analysis identified ∼300 factors, many part of essential protein modules such as the small subunit (SSU) processome, the eIF3 and chaperonin complexes, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We demonstrate a role for the vertebrate-specific factor RBIS in ribosome synthesis, uncover a requirement for the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase in nucleolar ribosome biogenesis, and reveal that intracellular glutamine synthesis supports 40S subunit production.},

	abstract = {With the use of an approach that is equivalent to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, it is possible to derive the axial and lateral gain factors of optical systems consisting of rotationally symmetric pupil plane filters with a large solid angle. We discuss the two- and three-dimensional cases. In contrast to previously published approaches, our results are valid for solid angles as large as 4π. The annular circular aperture is discussed as an example. Resolution gains for annular binary filters consisting of s transmitting rings are calculated, allowing the discussion of the optical properties of all rotationally symmetric binary filters in terms of gain factors. Optical systems with binary two-ring apertures are discussed; a special case is the 4Pi setup. Our novel method yields simple analytical formulas that are functions of the various aperture parameters.},

In a real optical system, however, the number of photons collected from a specimen determines the contrast and this limits the resolution. Contrast is affected by the number of picture elements per unit area, the number of photons and the aberrations present in every optical system. The concept of contrast vs. distance functions is used to compare the resolution achievable in confocal and wide-field fluorescence microscopes and the effect of a further reduction of the observable volume. In conclusio: (a) real optical systems will never be able to achieve the theoretical resolution, (b) wide-field fluorescence microscopy will often provide a better resolution than confocal fluorescence microscopy, (c) decreasing the observed volume does not necessarily increase the resolution and (d) using multiple fluorophores can improve the accuracy with which distances are measured.

Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) has joined confocal microscopy as a complementary system for the imaging of cell surface protein dynamics in mammalian and yeast systems because of its high temporal and spatial resolution. Here we present an alternative to TIRFM, termed variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM), for the visualization of protein dynamics at or near the plasma membrane of plant epidermal cells and root hairs in whole, intact seedlings that provides high-signal, low-background and near real-time imaging. VAEM uses highly oblique subcritical incident angles to decrease background fluorophore excitation. We discuss the utilities and advantages of VAEM for imaging of fluorescent fusion-tagged marker proteins in studying cortical cytoskeletal and membrane proteins. We believe that the application of VAEM will be an invaluable imaging tool for plant cell biologists.},

Although confocal and two-photon microscopy have revolutionized biomedical research, current implementations are costly, complex and limited in their ability to image three-dimensional volumes at high speeds. Light-sheet microscopy techniques using two-objective, orthogonal illumination and detection require a highly constrained sample geometry and either physical sample translation or complex synchronization of illumination and detection planes. In contrast, SCAPE microscopy acquires images using an angled, swept light sheet in a single-objective, en face geometry. Unique confocal descanning and image rotation optics map this moving plane onto a stationary high-speed camera, permitting completely translationless three-dimensional imaging of intact samples at rates exceeding 20 volumes per second. We demonstrate SCAPE microscopy by imaging spontaneous neuronal firing in the intact brain of awake behaving mice, as well as freely moving transgenic Drosophila larvae.},

Here we describe a microscope based on light-sheet illumination that allows massively parallel fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements and use it to visualize the diffusion and interactions of proteins in mammalian cells and in isolated fly tissue. Imaging the mobility of heterochromatin protein HP1α (ref. 4) in cell nuclei we could provide high-resolution diffusion maps that reveal euchromatin areas with heterochromatin-like HP1α-chromatin interactions.

Up until now, slicing resolutions down to 14μm have been obtained. We present a high resolution (HR) OPFOS method, which delivers images that approach the quality of histological sections. With our HROPFOS technique, we achieve in-plane resolutions of 1μm and a slicing resolution of 2μm. A region of interest within an intact and much larger object can be imaged without problems, and as the optical technique is nondestructive, the object can be measured in any slicing direction. We present quantitative measurements of resolution. A 3-D model reconstructed from our HROPFOS data is compared to SEM results, and the technique is demonstrated with section images and 3-D reconstructions of middle ear specimens.},

We demonstrate that this approach allows exceptionally low-noise imaging of large neuronal populations at pixel rates at least 100-fold higher than with LSM.

Here, we introduce two major improvements in OCPI microscopy. First, we miniaturize the objective coupler by using a uniaxial gradient-index lens to produce the light sheet. Second, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that refractive index mismatch at the fluid/tissue interface causes a significant defocus aberration. By introducing the ability to tune the angle of the light sheet, we show that defocus correction in a miniaturized OCPI microscope leads to a significant improvement in image sharpness deeper into tissue.},

We present a technique to enhance the optical sectioning capacity of a scanning light-sheet microscope by out-of-focus background rejection. The technique, called HiLo microscopy, makes use of two images sequentially acquired with uniform and structured sheet illumination. An optically sectioned image is then synthesized by fusing high and low spatial frequency information from both images. The benefits of combining light-sheet macroscopy and HiLo background rejection are demonstrated in optically cleared whole mouse brain samples, using both green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fluorescence and dark-field scattered light contrast.},

The pacemaker converges to the sinoatrial region during development and comprises fewer than a dozen cells by the time the heart loops. Perturbation of the activity of these cells was entirely reversible, demonstrating the resilience of the endogenous pacemaker. Our studies combine optogenetics and light-sheet microscopy to reveal the emergence of organ function during development.

It utilizes four collimated laser beams arranged along the axes of a tetrahedron to confine and move a microscopic sample in an aqueous medium. By adjusting the intensity of each beam individually the magnitude and direction of the optical forces acting on the sample, and via these its position, are controlled. Since only scattering forces are exploited the system is not confined to trapping near a geometrical focus, and therefore enables three-dimensional manipulation over ultra-long working distances. Latex beads 20μm in diameter can be positioned arbitrarily within a volume defined by the overlap of the four 100μm diameter beams. The sample is observed from four directions simultaneously, demonstrating the instrument’s potential as a universal manipulator in connection with high- and isotropic-resolution light microscopy.},

Understanding how forces are integrated at the tissue level and finally at the full animal scale is nowadays a major challenge that will allow shedding new light on how embryo morphogenesis takes place.

In order to provide a simple and easy to implement solution for such studies, a new Thin Light Sheet Microscope (TLSM) has been developed. The TLSM utilizes a well-defined sheet of laser light, which has a narrow (23 micron) axial dimension over a 1 mm × 1 mm field of view. This light sheet is positioned precisely within the depth of field of the microscope’s objective lens. The technique thus utilizes conventional microscope optics but replaces the illumination system. The advantages of the TLSM are two-fold: First, it concentrates light only where excitation is needed, thus maximizing the efficiency of the illumination source. Secondly, the TLSM maximizes image sharpness while at the same time minimizing the level of background noise. Particles that are not located within the objective’s depth of field are not illuminated and therefore do not contribute to an out-of-focus image. Images from a prototype system that used SYBR Green I fluorescence stain in order to localize single bacteria are reported. The bacteria were in a relatively large and undisturbed volume of 4ml, which contained natural seawater. The TLSM can be used for fresh water studies of bacteria with no modification. The microscope permits the observation of interactions at the microscale and has potential to yield insights into how microbes structure pelagic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Oil-immersion microscope objective lenses have been designed and optimized for the study of thin, two-dimensional object sections that are mounted immediately below the coverslip in a medium that is index matched to the immersion oil. It has been demonstrated both experimentally and through geometrical- and physical-optics theory that, when the microscope is not used with the correct coverslip or immersion oil, when the detector is not located at the optimal plane in image space, or when the object does not satisfy specific conditions, aberration will degrade both the contrast and the resolution of the image. In biology the most severe aberration is introduced when an oil-immersion objective lens is used to study thick specimens, such as living cells and tissues, whose refractive indices are significantly different from that of the immersion oil. We present a model of the three-dimensional imaging properties of a fluorescence light microscope subject to such aberration and compare the imaging properties predicted by the model with those measured experimentally. The model can be used to understand and compensate for aberration introduced to a microscope system under nondesign optical conditions so that both confocal laser scanning microscopy and optical serial sectioning microscopy can be optimized.},

	abstract = {The point spread function (PSF) plays a fundamental role in fluorescence microscopy. A realistic and accurately calculated PSF model can significantly improve the performance in 3D deconvolution microscopy and also the localization accuracy in single-molecule microscopy. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate approximation of the Gibson–Lanni model, which has been shown to represent the PSF suitably under a variety of imaging conditions. We express the Kirchhoff’s integral in this model as a linear combination of rescaled Bessel functions, thus providing an integral-free way for the calculation. The explicit approximation error in terms of parameters is given numerically. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach results in a significantly smaller computational time compared with current state-of-the-art techniques to achieve the same accuracy. This approach can also be extended to other microscopy PSF models.},
