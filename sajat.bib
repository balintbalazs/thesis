	abstract = {The goal of this analysis was to develop a computational tool that integrates the totality of gene expression, DNA copy number, and sequence abnormalities in individual cancers in the framework of biological processes. We used the hierarchical structure of the gene ontology (GO) database to create a reference network and projected mRNA expression, DNA copy number and mutation anomalies detected in single samples into this space. We applied our method to 59 breast cancers where all three types of molecular data were available. Each cancer had a large number of disturbed biological processes. Locomotion, multicellular organismal process, and signal transduction pathways were the most commonly affected GO terms, but the individual molecular events were different from case-to-case. Estrogen receptor-positive and -negative cancers had different repertoire of anomalies. We tested the functional impact of 27 mRNAs that had overexpression in cancer with variable frequency ({\textless}2–42 \%) using an siRNA screen. Each of these genes inhibited cell growth in at least some of 18 breast cancer cell lines. We developed a free, on-line software tool (http://​netgoplot.​org) to display the complex genomic abnormalities in individual cancers in the biological framework of the GO biological processes. Each cancer harbored a variable number of pathway anomalies and the individual molecular events that caused an anomaly varied from case-to-case. Our in vitro experiments indicate that rare case-specific molecular abnormalities can play a functional role and driver events may vary from case-to-case depending on the constellation of other molecular anomalies.},

To this end, reversibly switchable fluorophores located right above and below the focal plane are transferred to a nonfluorescent state at each scanning step. LS-RESOLFT nanoscopy offers wide-field 3D imaging of living biological specimens with low light dose and axial resolution far beyond the diffraction barrier. We demonstrate optical sections that are thinner by 5–12-fold compared with their conventional diffraction-limited LS analogs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The Syk tyrosine kinase plays an important role in diverse functions in hematopoietic lineage cells. Although previous in vitro and pharmacologic analyses suggested Syk to be a possible player in the development of autoimmune arthritis, no in vivo genetic studies addressing that issue have yet been reported. The aim of the present study was to test whether genetic deficiency of Syk affects autoantibody-induced experimental arthritis in the K/BxN serum-transfer model.


METHODS

Syk(-/-) bone marrow chimeras carrying a Syk-deficient hematopoietic system were generated by transplanting Syk(-/-) fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated wild-type recipients. After complete repopulation of the hematopoietic compartment, autoantibody-mediated arthritis was induced by injection of arthritogenic K/BxN serum. Arthritis development was monitored by macroscopic and microscopic observation of the ankle joints, micro-computed tomography of bone morphology, as well as a joint function assay.


RESULTS

Genetic deficiency of Syk in the hematopoietic compartment completely blocked the development of all macroscopic and microscopic signs of arthritis. The Syk(-/-) mutation also prevented the appearance of periarticular bone erosions. Finally, Syk(-/-) bone marrow chimeras were completely protected from arthritis-induced loss of articular function.


CONCLUSION

Our results indicate that Syk is critically involved in the development of all clinically relevant aspects of autoantibody-mediated K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis in experimental mice. These results provide the first in vivo genetic evidence of the role of Syk in the development of autoimmune arthritis.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, several gene expression-based predictors of clinical behavior were developed for breast cancer. A common feature of these is the use of multiple genes to predict hormone receptor status and the probability of tumor recurrence, survival or response to chemotherapy. We developed an online analysis tool to compute ER and HER2 status, Oncotype DX 21-gene recurrence score and an independent recurrence risk classification using gene expression data obtained by interrogation of Affymetrix microarray profiles. We implemented rigorous quality control algorithms to promptly exclude any biases related to sample processing, hybridization and scanning. After uploading the raw microarray data, the system performs the complete evaluation automatically and provides a report summarizing the results. The system is accessible online at http://www.recurrenceonline.com . We validated the system using data from 2,472 publicly available microarrays. The validation of the prediction of the 21-gene recurrence score was significant in lymph node negative patients (Cox-Mantel, P = 5.6E-16, HR = 0.4, CI = 0.32-0.5). A correct classification was obtained for 88.5\% of ER- and 90.5\% of ER + tumors (n = 1,894). The prediction of recurrence risk in all patients by using the mean of the independent six strongest genes (P {\textless} 1E-16, HR = 2.9, CI = 2.5-3.3), of the four strongest genes in lymph node negative ER positive patients (P {\textless} 1E-16, HR = 2.8, CI = 2.2-3.5) and of the three genes in lymph node positive patients (P = 3.2E-9, HR = 2.5, CI = 1.8-3.4) was highly significant. In summary, we integrated available knowledge in one platform to validate currently used predictors and to provide a global tool for the online determination of different prognostic parameters simultaneously using genome-wide microarrays.},

In addition to an efficient lossless mode, our algorithm also includes a lossy option, which limits pixel deviations to the intrinsic noise level of the image and yields compression ratio of up to 100-fold.
